This repo contains two small Java projects I worked on during my internship with Oasis Infobyte. These tasks helped me apply some of the Java basics I’ve been learning and were a fun way to build something from scratch.

 Project 1: ATM Interface
This is a simple console-based ATM simulation. The program allows users to:

Check their balance

Deposit money

Withdraw money

Exit the session

It doesn't connect to any real bank systems—just a basic logic to understand how an ATM works behind the scenes. It’s menu-driven, and I used Scanner for user input.

What I used are

Java classes & methods

Loops for menu navigation

Basic conditional logic

Project 2: Number Guessing Game
This one’s a small game where the computer picks a random number, and you have to guess it. The program gives hints like "Too high" or "Too low" until you get it right.

You can play as many rounds as you want, and it keeps track of how many guesses you took.

 What I practiced:

Random number generation

Loops and conditionals

User input and output

How to Run These Projects
Make sure Java is installed on your system.

Open terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder.

Compile the Java files:

javac AtmInterfaceExample.java
javac NumberGuessingGame.java
Run them:
java AtmInterfaceExample
java NumberGuessingGame
